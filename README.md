<br />

## Getting started

The ErmisChat client is designed to allow extension of the base types through use of generics when instantiated. By default, all generics are set to `Record<string, unknown>`.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### Step 1: Generate API key and ProjectID

Before installing ErmisChat SDK, you need to generate an **API key** and **ProjectID** on the [Ermis Dashboard](https://ermis.network). This **API key** and **ProjectID** will be required when initializing the Chat SDK.

> **Note**: Ermis Dashboard will be available soon. Please contact our support team to create a client account and receive your API key. Contact support: [tony@ermis.network](mailto:tony@ermis.network)

### Step 2: Install Chat SDK

You can install the Chat SDK with either `npm` or `yarn`.

**npm**

```bash
$ npm install ermis-chat-js-sdk
```

> Note: To use npm to install the Chat SDK, Node.js must be first installed on your system.

**yarn**

```bash
$ yarn add ermis-chat-js-sdk
```

### Step 3: Install WalletConnect

You need to install WalletConnect to sign in and login to the Chat SDK. For more details, refer to the [WalletConnect docs](https://docs.walletconnect.com/appkit/javascript/core/installation) and [Wagmi docs](https://wagmi.sh).

### Step 4: Integrate Login via Wallet

After installing WalletConnect, import the WalletConnect to initialize it:

```javascript
import { WalletConnect } from 'ermis-chat-js-sdk';
const authInstance = WalletConnect.getInstance(API_KEY, address);
```

#### 4.1: Create challenge

Create challenge message before signing with the wallet:

```javascript
const challenge = await authInstance.startAuth();
```

#### 4.2: Sign wallet and Get Token

After receiving the challenge message, sign the wallet to get the signature using [useSignTypedData](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useSignTypedData), then retrieve the token:

```javascript
const response = await authInstance.getAuth(api_key, address, signature);
```

### Step 5: Import the Chat SDk

On the client-side, initialize the Chat client with your **API key** and **ProjectID**:

```javascript
import { ErmisChat } from 'ermis-chat-js-sdk';

const options = {
  timeout: 6000,
  baseURL: BASE_URL,
}; // optional

const chatClient = ErmisChat.getInstance(API_KEY, PROJECT_ID, options);
```

Once initialized, you must specify the current user with connectUser:

```javascript
await chatClient.connectUser(
  {
    api_key: API_KEY,
    id: address, // your address
    name: address,
  },
  `Bearer ${token}`,
);
```

### Step 6: Sending your first message

Now that the Chat SDK has been imported, you're ready to start sending messages.
Here are the steps to send your first message using the Chat SDK:

**Send a message to the channel**:

```javascript
const channel = chatClient.channel(channel_type, channel_id);
await channel.sendMessage({
  text: 'Hello',
});
```

| :------- | :--- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dataUser | func | No       | The **dataUser** function can be used to receive user profile update data via an Event Source connection. When an update event occurs, the relevant user profile data will be sent to this function and logged to the console. |

**Disconnect**:

```javascript
await chatClient.disconnectFromSSE();
```

<br />

### Channel management

#### 1. Query channels

Retrieve all channels and Drirect Messages in your project. Hereâ€™s an example of how to query the list of channels:

```javascript
const filter = {
  type: ['messaging', 'team'],
  roles: ['owner', 'moder', 'member', 'pending'],
  other_roles: ['pending'], // optional
  limit: 3, // optional
  offset: 0, // optional
};
const sort = [{ last_message_at: -1 }];
const options = {
  message_limit: 25,
};

await chatClient.queryChannels(filter, sort, options);
```

**Filter:**

Type: Object. The query filters to use. You can filter by any custom fields you've defined on the Channel.
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :-----------| :-- | :---------| :-----------|
| type | array | No | The type of channel: messaging, team. If the array is empty, it will return all channels.
| roles | array | No | This method is used to retrieve a list of channels that the current user is a part of. The API supports filtering channels based on the user's role within each channel, including roles such as `owner`, `moder`, `member`, and `pending`.<br /><br />`owner` - Retrieves a list of channels where the user's role is the owner. <br />`moder` - Retrieves a list of channels where the user's role is the moderator. <br />`member` - Retrieves a list of channels where the user's role is a member. <br /> `pending` - Retrieves a list of channels where the user's role is pending approval.
| other_roles | array | No | This API allows you to retrieve a list of channels that you have created, with the ability to filter channels based on the roles of other users within the channel. The roles available for filtering include: `owner`, `moder`, `member`, and `pending`.<br /><br /> `owner` - Filter channels where the user is the channel owner.</br> `moder` - Filter channels where the user is a moderator.</br> `member` - Filter channels where the user is a member. </br> `pending` - Filter channels where the user is pending approval.
| limit | integer | No | The maximum number of channels to retrieve in a single request.
| offset | integer | No | The starting position for data retrieval. This parameter allows you to retrieve channels starting from a specific position, useful for paginating through results. For example, offset: 30 will start retrieving channels from position 31 in the list.

**Sort:**

Type: Object or array of objects. The sorting used for the channels that match the filters. Sorting is based on the field and direction, and multiple sorting options can be provided. You can sort based on fields such as `last_message_at`. Direction can be ascending (1) or descending (-1).

```javascript
const sort = [{ last_message_at: -1 }];
```

**Options:**

Type: Object. This method can be used to fetch information about existing channels, including message counts and other related details.
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :-----------| :--- | :---------| :-----------|
| message_limit | integer | No | The maximum number of messages to retrieve from each channel. If this parameter is not provided, the default number of messages or no limit will be applied.

```javascript
const options = { message_limit: 25 };
```

#### 2. Create a New Channel

To create a channel: choose Direct for 1-1 (messaging) or Channel (team) for multiple users.

**New direct message**

```javascript
// channel type is messaging

// channel type is team
const channel = await chatClient.channel('team', {
  name: 'Ermis group',
  members: ['user_id_1', 'user_id_2', 'user_id_3', ...],
});
await channel.create();
```

| Name    | Type   | Required | Description                                      |

#### 6. Unread messages

The Unread Message Count indicates how many messages were received wwhile a user was offline. After reconnecting or logging in, user can view the total number of missed messages in a channel or DM.

**Get unread messages count (all channels)**
`getUnreadCount()` returns information on all unread messages across all joined channels. You can display this number in the UI within the channel list of your chat app.

```javascript
await chatClient.getUnreadCount(userId);
```

**Marking a channel as read**
You can mark all messages in a channel as read on the client-side:

```javascript
await channel.markRead();
```

**Jump to last read message**
This is how you can jump to the last read message in a specific channel:

```javascript
const channel = chatClient.channel(channel_type, channel_id);
await channel.query();

const lastReadMessageId = channel.state.read['<user id>'];
await channel.state.loadMessageIntoState(lastReadMessageId);

console.log(channel.state.messages);
```

| reaction_type | string | Yes      | Type of the reaction. User could have only 1 reaction of each type per message |

#### 8. Typing Indicators

Typing indicators feature lets users see who is currently typing in the channel

```javascript
// sends a typing.start event at most once every two seconds
await channel.keystroke();

// sends the typing.stop event
await channel.stopTyping();
```

When sending events on user input, you should make sure to follow some best-practices to avoid bugs.

- Only send `typing.start` when the user starts typing
- Send `typing.stop` after a few seconds since the last keystroke

**Receiving typing indicator events**

```javascript
// start typing event handling
channel.on('typing.start', (event) => {
  console.log(event);
});

// stop typing event handling
channel.on('typing.stop', (event) => {
  console.log(event);
});
```

<br />

### Events

Events keep the client updated with changes in a channel, such as new messages, reactions, or members joining the channel.
A full list of events is shown below. The next section of the documentation explains how to listen for these events.
| Event | Trigger | Recipients
|:---|:----|:-----
| `health.check` | every 30 second to confirm that the client connection is still alive | all clients
| `message.new` | when a new message is added on a channel | clients watching the channel
| `message.read` | when a channel is marked as read | clients watching the channel
| `message.deleted` | when a message is deleted | clients watching the channel
| `message.updated` | when a message is updated | clients watching the channel
| `typing.start` | when a user starts typing | clients watching the channel
| `typing.stop` | when a user stops typing | clients watching the channel
| `reaction.new` | when a message reaction is added | clients watching the channel
| `reaction.deleted` | when a message reaction is deleted | clients watching the channel
| `member.added` | when a member is added to a channel | clients watching the channel
| `member.removed` | when a member is removed from a channel | clients watching the channel
| `member.promoted` | when a member is added moderator to a channel | clients watching the channel
| `member.demoted` | when a member is removed moderator to a channel | clients watching the channel
| `member.banned` | when a member is ban to a channel | clients watching the channel
| `member.unbanned` | when a member is unban to a channel | clients watching the channel
| `notification.added_to_channel` | when the user is added to the list of channel members | clients from the user added that are not watching the channel
| `notification.invite_accepted` | when the user accepts an invite | clients from the user invited that are not watching the channel
| `notification.invite_rejected` | when the user rejects an invite | clients from the user invited that are not watching the channel
| `channel.deleted` | when a channel is deleted | clients watching the channel
| `channel.updated` | when a channel is updated | clients watching the channel

#### 1. Listening for Events

Once you call watch on a Channel or queryChannels, you will start listening for these events. You can then hook into specific events:

```javascript
channel.on('message.deleted', (event) => {
  console.log('event', event);
});
```

You can also listen to all events at once:

```javascript
channel.on((event) => {
  console.log('event', event);
});
```

#### 2. Client Events

Not all events are specific to channels. Events such as changes in the user's status,unread count, and other notifications are sent as client events. These events can be listened to directly through the client:

```javascript
chatClient.on((event) => {
  console.log('event', event);
});
```

#### 3. Stop listening for Events

It is good practice to unregister event handlers when they are no longer in use. This helps prevent performance issue due to memory leaks and avoids potential errors and exceptions (i.e. null pointer exceptions)

```javascript
// remove the handler from all client events
// const myClientEventListener = client.on('connection.changed', myClientEventHandler)
myClientEventListener.unsubscribe();

// remove the handler from all events on a channel
// const myChannelEventListener = channel.on('connection.changed', myChannelEventHandler)
myChannelEventListener.unsubscribe();
```

## Error codes

Below you can find the complete list of errors that are returned by the API together with the description, API code, and corresponding HTTP, Websocket status of each error.

#### 1. HTTP codes

| Name                      | HTTP Status Code | HTTP Status           | Ermis code | Description                                               |
